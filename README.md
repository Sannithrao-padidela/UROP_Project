# UROP_Project
This project uses machine learning (ML) and image processing to detect plant diseases. Using the Plant-Village-Dataset, it classifies apple leaves as healthy or diseased. It applies HOG and histogram features for feature extraction, training an ML model for accurate, automated, and non-invasive disease detection in precision agriculture.
